# Sophoz
## TL;DR
No longer maintained ðŸ˜¢ due to lack of time, because of the CPGE. This was a sketch of a project we wanted to build

## Motivation
This began as a side project in Terminale (in 2023) with 2 friends. 

Here is the analysis of the news landscape we had:
### News are unappealing for teenagers

This was, and still is, a major issue for us. We think that news are too long to read and difficult to understand for teenagers. We wanted to build a simple medium for people in high schools to be informed daily about the news.
### News are often very biased 

We also wanted to tackle the issue of the bias when reading news. The [Valeurs actuelles](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeurs_actuelles) and the [LibÃ©ration](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lib%C3%A9ration_(journal)) newspapers deal with the same subjects but have **strongly different** viewpoints. Unless you read the 2, it wil be difficult to understand the news objectively.
### New format

We wanted to create a new format for reading news. Our roadmap was to first build a text-based app then add diagrams and mind maps to have a concise but precise summary of the daily/weekly news. Our goal was to use LLMs to build fast, reliable (-ish), and coherent news analyses.

[This website](https://sophoz.vercel.app/) was our landing page at we used it to have an idea of who could be interested. We added a form to sign up for weekly news of Sophoz and had roughly 30 users. We stopped the project because we all chose intensive paths following high schools and did not have time to continue.
